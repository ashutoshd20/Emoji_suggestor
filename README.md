# Emoji_suggestor
A word embedding based LSTM model which auto suggests an emoji with input sentences being less than 10 words.
The input size is limited to 10 words now but i hope to increase it innear future.
I will also appreciate if you could provide me with another batches of dataset inorder to inprove my performance.
To run all codes in your own computer follow these processes:
1. download all files and store them in same location.
2. download and extract appropriate glove text folder required in the code.
3. run the 'run me to enjoy' file.
